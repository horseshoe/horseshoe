# Example Java Gradle Project

This project is a simple gradle java application runner that creates a file at `build/generated/HelloWorld.txt` with the contents `Hello, world!`.

This example can be expanded to include any of the templates that are present in the `samples/data` directory.

Use `./gradlew run` or `.\gradlew.bat run` to see this example in action.
